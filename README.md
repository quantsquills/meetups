# Hacks/Hackers Brisbane

Some historical data about speakers, events and talks that have been part of [Hacks/Hackers Brisbane](https://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Brisbane/).

The issues area of this repository is also where we do most of the organising for future events. So, if you'd like to [propose a talk](https://github.com/quantsquills/meetups/issues/new?template=talk_proposal.md&labels=talk-proposal).

If you're helping organise a specific event that doesn't have one yet, you could [open an event checklist](https://github.com/quantsquills/meetups/issues/new?template=event_checklist.md&labels=event) ticket.
